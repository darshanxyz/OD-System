# OD-System

# What's an OD Management System?
An Application which allows the students for applying the ODs and which allows the advisors to approve the ODs or deny it depending upon the reason specified.

# What's our motivation for this application? Why did we develop this?
We intend to make it easy for the teachers to track and manage the ODs and for the students to easily apply for the ODs. Sounds good? 

# What’s the plan for the near-future for this application?
We intend to sync it with the official database of the AUMS. This will be of great use for the next batches to come!
