# OD-System

# What's an OD Management System?
An Application which allows the students for applying the ODs and which allows the advisors to approve the ODs or deny it depending upon the reason specified.

# Working Flow of the Application?
Here first of all, the student applies for the OD by sending a request after signing in through his Gmail account. Once the request is sent, he gets a notification with the help of a toast message. Now the advisor signs in and views the list of ODs, and approves them depending upon the reason specified. After approving the OD, it is mailed to the subject teacher with all the necessary details. Quite Simple, right?

# What's our motivation for this application? Why did we develop this?
We intend to make it easy for the teachers to track and manage the ODs and for the students to easily apply for the ODs. Sounds good? 

# Whatâ€™s the plan for the near-future for this application?
We intend to sync it with the official database of the AUMS. This will be of great use for the next batches to come!
